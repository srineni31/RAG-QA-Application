A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q&A application is an AI-powered system designed to answer user queries by combining two key components:

Retrieval: The system first fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base (e.g., a database, vector store, or external sources) that are related to the user's query. This ensures that responses are grounded in relevant and up-to-date information.

Generation: The retrieved information is then passed to a large language model (LLM), like GPT-4, which generates a well-structured and contextually accurate response. This step ensures that the answer is coherent and user-friendly.

What a RAG Q&A Application Does
Provides accurate and context-aware responses by fetching relevant documents before answering.
Reduces hallucinations (incorrect or made-up answers) by grounding responses in real data.
Works with private and proprietary knowledge bases, allowing organizations to customize answers based on their specific documents.
Improves over time with better retrieval strategies and fine-tuned models.
